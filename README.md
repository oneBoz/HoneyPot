Feature/User Story:
As a college student, I need to create a budget for my monthly expenses to manage my finances effectively. To do this, the system should allow me to input my income and expenses, categorize transactions, and track my spending against budget limits.
As a young adult, I want to set savings goals for emergencies, travel, and other financial milestones. To do this, the system should allow me to define specific savings goals, set timelines, and track my progress towards achieving them.
As a user seeking to improve financial literacy, I need access to educational resources to learn about budgeting, saving, investing, and other financial topics. To do this, the system should provide articles, and content on relevant financial subjects.
As a user interested in investing, I want to track the performance of my investment portfolio. To do this, the system should allow me to input my investment holdings, monitor returns, and analyze portfolio diversification.
For the next milestone, we will do features 1, 2, 3. We will save feature 4 and other fixes that the peer teams suggest in milestone 3.
